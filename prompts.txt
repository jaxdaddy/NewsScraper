1. Market Movers Insight
Analyze the attached COR Movers reports. Identify patterns among the top positive and negative movers across both dates. Which sectors or industries appear most consistently represented, and what market forces might explain these movements? Provide a concise summary using Markdown bullet points for key findings and insights.

2. Company-Specific News Impact
Cross-reference the ticker symbols in the COR Movers reports with the NewsSummary file. Highlight which companies had significant stock moves but little or no associated news coverage. What risks or opportunities does this mismatch suggest? Provide your response as a Markdown table with columns: Symbol, Net Change, News Coverage, Risks, Opportunities. Follow with a bulleted list of general risks and opportunities.

3. Emerging Risk Signals
From the negative movers in the COR Movers reports, identify companies showing steep declines without clear supporting news in the NewsSummary. Suggest potential hidden risks (such as sector-wide headwinds, macroeconomic pressures, or regulatory concerns) that could be influencing these stocks. Provide your response as a Markdown bulleted list, with each risk clearly explained.

4. Momentum & Sentiment Analysis
Compare the positive movers in the COR Movers reports with their recent news summaries. For each, evaluate whether the news coverage supports sustained momentum or whether the moves may be short-lived hype. Provide a sentiment rating (positive, neutral, negative) with reasoning. Present your analysis as a Markdown table with columns: Company, Stock Move, News Support, Sentiment Rating, Reasoning.

5. Strategic Investment Watchlist
Based on both the movers’ data and the news coverage, create a shortlist of 5–7 companies worth monitoring for investment opportunities. For each, briefly summarize the stock move, related news drivers (if any), and your recommendation for why it should remain on a watchlist. Present this as a Markdown numbered list, with each item detailing the company, stock move, news drivers, and recommendation.
